# "Breaking Barriers to Science while Building a Long-lasting Legacy in our Communities" 

Is a curriculum-linked science enrichment program with a mission to increase access to and engagement with STEM among high school students from our local community at Scarborough. 

With this FREE science enrichment program, we hope to help break down the systemic barrier to access in education by connecting high school students from under-represented and under-served local communities in Scarborough with UTSC students, researcher, staff and faculty.

This one-of-a-kind science enrichment program includes workshops, discussions, mentorship opportunities for students pursuing careers in STEM and will upscale the scientific skills of high school students and teachers. 

STEM grade 9 high school students will be provided with the chance to conduct innovative research experiments in the UTSC teaching laboratories and to present their findings to other high school students in a closing event to be held at UTSC. 

This project has been financially supported by the UTSC 60th Legacy Award (https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/home/u-t-scarborough-60), the Department of Biological Sciences E.D.I Committee (through a P.I.E grant, https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/biosci/biological-sciences-edi), and in-kind support by the Andrade lab (https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/labs/andrade/personnel/), and the Departments of Biological Sciences and Computer and Mathematical Sciences at UTSC.
